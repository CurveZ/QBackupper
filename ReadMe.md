# Backupper

Backupper is a simple utility that creates a copy of the files in a selected directory and places them in a timestamped subfolder named `backups/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`. This repository contains versions for both Windows and Linux.

A personal tool, one of the simplest yet most frequently used. So why not share it? It may be a peculiar program, but if the shoe fits, wear it, Cinderella.
