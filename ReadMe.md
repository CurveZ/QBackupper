# Backupper

I’m sharing this project because I often work with files in a folder. Whether I’m writing, editing, or working on important documents or programming files, I like to make a quick copy before making any major changes. Q™Backupper makes this process extremely easy and convenient, which is why I use it so often and wanted to share it with others.


Backupper is a simple utility that creates a copy of the files in a selected directory and places them in a timestamped subfolder named `backups/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`. This repository contains versions for both Windows and Linux.

A personal tool, one of the simplest yet most frequently used. So why not share it? It may be a peculiar program, but if the shoe fits, wear it, Cinderella.
